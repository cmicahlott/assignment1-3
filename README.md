## Worth: 30 points
## Due: 3 days

1. How do the results compare between job search results for "arcgis server" vs. "geoserver"? Discuss your findings with respect to number of jobs, salaries, and types of jobs. Be aware of jobs that are tagged as "sponsored" `7 pts`.

One difference between the two searches is that searching for "arcgis server" yields more specific results pertaining to the usage of ESRI ArcGIS products. Saerching for "geoserver" yields more general results of companies looking for geospatially skilled people. The salary range for "arcgis server" includes lower pay than for "geoserver." For example, the listed salaries from searching "arcgis server" is about $65k to $110k. The salary range for "geoserver" starts at around $80k to $125k. The job type for "arcgis server" includes more types than for "geoserver", which only seems to include full-time and part-time. For "arcgis server", there are full-time, part-time, temporary, contract, and internship jobs. 

2. Look through the class syllabus and search for additional technologies and compare the job search results to searches with similar software you know (e.g., arcgis vs. qgis, sde vs. postgis, arcgis javascript vs. openlayers or leaflet `7 pts`.

When searching for "QGIS" vs "ArcGIS", the first difference noted was the amount of jobs within each job type. When searching for "ArcGIS", there are far more jobs available within each job type than when searching "QGIS". There are nearly 2500 full-time jobs available on Indeed when searching for "ArcGIS" and only 205 full-time jobs available for "QGIS". When searching for "arcgis javascript" vs "openlayers", "arcgis javascript" results in more job types and more jobs than "openlayers". Search results from "arcgis javascript" yield specifics to ArcGIS productions whereas "openlayers" yields more general geospatial work.  

3. Perform similar searches as above but add "git" or "docker" to the search query. How does that change the search results? `7 pts`

I searched "arcgis javascript git" and notied the range for job types shortened. When adding "git" to the search, the results seem to be more pertained to development of geosptial solutions. Similar findings when adding "git" to "openlayers", there are only 18 full-time jobs listed and no others. The results of this search also come up with mostly developer jobs as it did with "arcgis javascript git". 

4. Assume you have acquired the skills listed in the syllabus. Find one job advertisement that you would not have otherwise found or realized you were qualified for. Describe why that job is interesting to you and why it would not have been on your radar previously. `7 pts`

When searching "QGIS", I found this job ad that caught my eye: https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=QGIS&l&vjk=3db35390837fbd74
Mostly, it wouldn't have caught my eye bevause I have not been searching for jobs in this field yet (I need to, but I digress). The job interests me because I am wanting to use my degree to work toward fighting environmental inequities. There is little doubt that we will, at some point, face a real threat to drinking water in this country - if we are not already at this point. This job stood out to me because of my interest in working to keep drinking water free not only from contaminants but from hyper-capitalistic ideology that could one day make drinking water a kind of currency.
